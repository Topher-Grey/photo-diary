# Moment Escape

A website where the user is able to login,
upload their photo, and add a diary message

Maybe this all comes down to moments of acting
but in a way we all escape when reality
presents itself. The truth behind every experession
is released and we see the light for what it is.
When we lay next to someone and we begin
to match their breath. The silence fills
our hearts and we can't leave their side.

However, once you have been conditioned by those
you love. The vibrations that make up our moments
of life condition us to not let go of instinct to search
for the same happiness throughout oour life.
In a moments escape, you can find a place
to log your memories of past events,
or fleeting memories while they 
shape the moments of your life.
